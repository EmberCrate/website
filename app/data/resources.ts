      The team I work with are big fans of TypeScript and we've invested a lot of time updating our Ember codebase to be mostly TypeScript now. This has been excellent for maintainability and allowing us to safely add features.

      We've got multiple apps we look after and the largest one is over 10 years old. Over the years we invested our time to continuous improvement. The app has extensive tests, visual regression testing and excellent continuous integration pipeline and we deploy frequently.

      As we've invested in adding TypeScript to our apps we've seen a reduction in errors that get our into production. This is excellent, but we've still been lacking the ability to use the types in our templates, so there's still a bit of guesswork.

The project has three main goals: to align Ember with the modern npm packaging system, continue to invest and innovate in reactivity, and encourage universal design principles.

      Like many developers, Godfrey came to Ember from Rails. Months after chatting with Yehuda and Tom Dale at EmberConf, Godfrey was hired at Tilde and thrown into the Ember deep end. Today, Godfrey‚Äôs focused on big picture developments, tackling lofty goals like developing an Ember model to navigate JavaScript classes.

      In this episode, Godfrey talks with Chuck and Robbie about what‚Äôs to come for Polaris, solving major developer headaches, Godfrey‚Äôs philosophy on frameworks, top use cases for solutions like Starbeam, and why these innovations are necessary in 2022.

His primary goal became solving semantic versioning for TS. As Chris kept iterating, striving to combine multiple programming worlds, other engineers joined him in the pursuit until eventually, the Ember TypeScript Core team was born.

      Today, Chris is a lead engineer at LinkedIn, a father, husband, runner, music composer, and whiskey enthusiast. His current goal is to ensure Ember Polaris has first-class TypeScript support. Aside from offering new dad advice to Robbie, Chris also describes what can become a superpower for new developers willing to work.

      In this episode, Chris talks with Chuck and Robbie about best-case uses for TypeScript, a defense of complicated library code, Chris‚Äô ultimate goal with software engineering, and his advice for programmers on the rise.

    description: `
